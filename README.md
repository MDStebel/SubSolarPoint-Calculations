Astronomical computations in Swift and Python.

## 1. Subsolar-Point
Computes the subsolar point at the current time.

The subsolar point is the location on a planet or celestial body’s surface where the sun is perceived to be directly overhead at a given moment. This means the sun’s rays are hitting the surface at a 90-degree angle, and it is the point on the surface that receives the most direct sunlight. For Earth, the subsolar point moves across the surface as the Earth rotates and orbits the sun, and it is always located somewhere between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, depending on the time of year.

This code is based on the code I use in ISS Real-Time Tracker 3D.
